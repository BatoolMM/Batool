              I started as a pharmacologist and made a transition to <b>computational biology and bioinformatics</b> during my Ph.D.
              The focus of my Ph.D. was on exploring the <a href="https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.778524">potential vulnerability of Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)</a>, particularly in the DNA repair pathways.
              Having worked with various tools and techniques in genetics and structural biology, I obtained a unique blend of interests, including the use of machine learning algorithms to answer biological questions.

Our focus was on developing interpretable predictions for clinicians to support their decision making. We investigated a variety of techniques, with a particular emphasis on gradient-based and perturbation-based attribution methods. Our research resulted in the identification of Guided GradCam as the most insightful method for understanding the relative influence of input features on the classification process to identify potential failure modes such as false negative predictions. The results of this project have been published in a <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5729340">preprint</a>. </p>

                    <p>I am honored to be a mentor and co-facilitator in <a href="https://openlifesci.org/">the Open Life Science (OLS) program</a>, which is based on the Mozilla Open Leader Program and aims to help individuals and stakeholders become Open Science ambassadors. I have been a mentor for both OLS5 and OLS6, and one of the projects I mentored was led by Biandri Joubert, which aimed to create an open educational resource that demonstrates the "why" for people from legal backgrounds who might want to learn R. The project is partly a case for open and reproducible research in a field that does not typically use R and quantitative methods. The project also involves creating different data sets derived from commonly used legal sources that law students or graduates would be familiar with and incorporating them into a single platform with a few examples of practical use and application, as well as code. I am excited to be a part of this initiative and contribute to the advancement of open and reproducible research in legal field.</p>

                    <p>I had the opportunity to spend a month in two cities in Uganda, Hoima and Kampala, as part of the Liverpool-Mulago Partnership. The partnership is a collaboration between the University of Liverpool and Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala, Uganda that aims to improve maternal and child health outcomes in Uganda.

                      During my time there, I had the opportunity to assist in the hospital and provide support to the medical staff. In addition, I was involved in collecting and analyzing data regarding infant mortality in the region. The data collected will be used to identify the main causes of infant mortality and to develop strategies to reduce the rate of infant mortality in Uganda.
                      
                      This experience was extremely valuable to me as it gave me the opportunity to learn about the challenges that people in the region face and the impact of poor maternal and child health on their lives. </p>

                      As a member of the organizing committee, I played an active role in the planning and execution of the conference. I was in charge of the newbie's event, which was designed to provide a supportive environment for individuals who are new or never contributed to the R community. The event helped to introduce new members to the R community and provided them with the resources and support they need to become active contributors. I was also part of the Code of Conduct response team, which is responsible for ensuring that the conference is a safe and inclusive space for all attendees.
