      <h2>About</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="content" style="text-align: left;">

      <p>
        I am an Honorary Research Fellow at <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/"><b>the University of Liverpool</b></a> and, until May 2025, was the Research Project Manager for the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/ai-multiple-long-term-conditions-research-support-facility"><b>AI for Multiple Long-Term Conditions: Research Support Facility (AIM RSF)</b></a> at <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/"><b>The Alan Turing Institute</b></a>. The AIM RSF is part of a broader £23 million initiative by the <a href="https://www.nihr.ac.uk/"><b>National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR)</b></a> focused on artificial intelligence and multi-morbidity. I helped shape the programme’s delivery and governance, connecting 27 institutions across the UK to support long-term, real-world impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since June 2025, I’ve been the Manager of <a href="http://imago.ac.uk/"><b>Imago (Imagery Smart Data Service)</b></a>, part of the <a href="https://www.sdruk.ukri.org"><b>Smart Data Research UK</b></a> programme funded by the ESRC. Imago focuses on enhancing the usability and utility of satellite imagery to inform public health, urban planning, and policy decisions. The service is designed to help address challenges around housing, environmental risks, and health equity. It’s a collaboration between the University of Liverpool, Newcastle University, and Harvard University aimed at helping social scientists and policymakers address challenges around prosperity, wellbeing, and sustainability using satellite imagery data.

          <p>
            My work spans academic research, infrastructure, and policy. I started as a postdoctoral researcher, working in isolation. Gradually, I moved into roles that let me understand the broader ecosystem—funding priorities, decision-making processes, and gaps that exclude key voices from influencing research agendas.
          </p>

          <p>
            I now collaborate with early-career researchers, public contributors, and grassroots communities to bring more equitable representation into these systems. I advocate for open science and represent the Arab region on the <a href="https://www.iau-aiu.net/"><b>International Association of Universities (IAU)</b></a> Expert Group on Open Science, developed in collaboration with UNESCO. This work involves developing actionable frameworks and sharing best practices that support sustainable and inclusive open science across global higher education institutions.
          </p>

          <p>
            With a commitment to addressing inequities in how knowledge is created and shared, I see open science as a form of decolonisation—supporting diverse ways of knowing and challenging historical patterns of exclusion. I founded <a href="https://osc-ksa.com/"><b>Open Science Community Saudi Arabia (OSCSA)</b></a> to promote open research across Arabic-speaking countries, reduce infrastructure barriers, and produce Arabic-language resources tailored to regional needs.
          </p>

          <p>
            I completed my PhD in Computational Biology at the University of Liverpool, where I worked on triple-negative breast cancer. My research combined machine learning with molecular dynamics simulations to study DNA repair mechanisms. Later, I joined <a href="https://www.odinvision.com/"><b>Odin Vision</b></a> through a Data Study Group to apply explainable AI to clinical diagnostics.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2023, I was recruited as a Subject Matter Expert for <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science"><b>NASA’s Transform to Open Science (TOPS)</b></a> programme, where I helped co-develop training for a global audience. I was selected as a jury member (2024–2026) for the <a href="https://www.einsteinfoundation.de/award/"><b>Einstein Foundation Award for Promoting Quality in Research</b></a> and named a DWeb Fellow by the <a href="https://www.archive.org/"><b>Internet Archive</b></a>, contributing to global conversations on decentralised technologies and knowledge justice.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am part of the governance team at <a href="https://openlifesci.org/"><b>Open Life Science (OLS)</b></a>, where I mentor early-career researchers building open science projects. I also founded the first <a href="https://rladies.org/"><b>R-Ladies</b></a> chapter in the Arabian Gulf (Dammam) and now serve on the global leadership team, helping grow the R community through collaboration and skill-sharing.
          </p>

          <p>
            My public engagement work has taken me to conferences and panels in the UK, the UAE, the Netherlands, the US, Kuwait, and Germany. In 2023, I spoke at <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/ai-uk-2023"><b>AI-UK</b></a> on responsible tech governance, and in 2024, at the UN Internet Governance Forum on breaking tech monopolies through interoperability. I’ve also contributed to <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en"><b>UNESCO</b></a>’s Working Group on Open Science Policies.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’ve helped organise several global events, including <a href="https://user2021.r-project.org/"><b>useR! 2021</b></a>, the <a href="https://fairdo.org/fdo2024-conference/"><b>FAIR Digital Object Implementation Summit</b></a>, the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/pioneering-ai-mltc-bridging-research-and-practice"><b>Pioneering AI in MLTC Conference 2024</b></a>, and the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/global-dynamics-in-responsible-research-tickets-457586169727"><b>Global Dynamics in Responsible Research 2022</b></a> unconference.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’ve reviewed manuscripts for <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/"><b>PLOS Computational Biology</b></a>, <a href="https://journal.r-project.org/"><b>R Journal</b></a>, and <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/"><b>Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)</b></a>. I’m also a certified <a href="https://carpentries.org/"><b>Carpentries</b></a> instructor and member of the Education Committee at the <a href="https://www.iscb.org/"><b>International Society of Computational Biology (ISCB)</b></a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I’m not coding, I’m probably somewhere unexpected—on an unplanned road trip, exploring unfamiliar landscapes.

Our focus was on developing interpretable predictions for clinicians to support their decision making. We investigated a variety of techniques, with a particular emphasis on gradient-based and perturbation-based attribution methods. Our research resulted in the identification of Guided GradCam as the most insightful method for understanding the relative influence of input features on the classification process to identify potential failure modes such as false negative predictions. The results of this project have been published in a <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5729340">preprint</a>. </p>

I have been a mentor for both OLS5 and OLS6, and one of the projects I mentored was led by Biandri Joubert, which aimed to create an open educational resource that demonstrates the "why" for people from legal backgrounds who might want to learn R. The project is partly a case for open and reproducible research in a field that does not typically use R and quantitative methods. The project also involves creating different data sets derived from commonly used legal sources that law students or graduates would be familiar with and incorporating them into a single platform with a few examples of practical use and application, as well as code. I am excited to be a part of this initiative and contribute to the advancement of open and reproducible research in legal field.</p>

                    <p>I had the opportunity to spend a month in two cities in Uganda, Hoima and Kampala, as part of the Liverpool-Mulago Partnership. The partnership is a collaboration between the University of Liverpool and Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala, Uganda that aims to improve maternal and child health outcomes in Uganda.

                      During my time there, I had the opportunity to assist in the hospital and provide support to the medical staff.

                I occasionally write blog posts since it allows me to merge my love for writing with everything else I’m passionate about.
                I write about coding, deep Learning (ML) and try to simplify scientific concepts and make it easier to learn, understand and use, without sacrificing its power and usefulness.
